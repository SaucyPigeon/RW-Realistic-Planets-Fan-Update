		<description>Though most commonly associated with subtropical savannas, the hardy acacia tree is actually native to a wide variety of habitats, including alpine settings, rainforests, woodlands, grasslands, coastal dunes and deserts. Acacias are known for their ability to tolerate high alkalinity, drought, high temperatures, sandy or stony soil, strongly sloped rooting surfaces, and sand blasting. They have sharp thorns, and don't provide much wood.</description>
